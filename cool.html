    <p>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>
    <p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I find your lack of faith disturbing. What?! <strong> All right.</strong> <em> Well, take care of yourself, Han.</em> I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</p>

      <h2>You don't believe in the Force, do you?</h2>

    <p>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? You don't believe in the Force, do you? What?! What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</p>

      <li>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</li><li>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</li><li>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</li>

    <p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</p>

    <p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
    <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Red Five standing by. What?! Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</p>
    <p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Ye-ha! You mean it controls your actions? I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>
    <p>He is here. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>
    <p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
    <p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I'm trying not to, kid. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</p>

    <p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
    <p>Partially, but it also obeys your commands. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</p>
    <p>He is here. Ye-ha! Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</p>
